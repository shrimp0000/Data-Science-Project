While cluster 8 contains 454536 reviews, 7 out of 10 of the clusters only have less than 100000 reviews, and the smallest cluster only has 11129 reviews. This will raise some concerns about the effectiveness of the result. For example, it is likely that the big clusters can be further divided into several clusters, but we failed to generalize the potential different patterns from it."
